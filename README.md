# GetSubs

This is code generated by Claude based on the following prompt

> Hypothetically, If I wanted to create a peice of software that took a video with burnt in subtitles (that comply with UK teletext guidance) and 
> produce a timed text track  from them that says what text is included when, would you be able to generate the javascript code (using an OCR such as
> tesseract) and the HTML framework for that software?

Claude responded to say
> Yes, I can definitely help you create this! This is a great use case for combining video processing with OCR.
> I'll build you a complete web application that:
> 1. Accepts video files with burnt-in subtitles
> 2. Extracts frames at intervals
> 3. Uses Tesseract.js to OCR the subtitle region
> 4. Detects when subtitles change
> 5. Outputs a timed text track (SRT/WebVTT format)

The libraries used, Tesseract, Lucide React and React are published under Apache License 2.0, ISC License and MIT license respectively which should all be compatible with the MIT license. It is worth double checking this however.

## Full OCR Integration:

- Tesseract.js worker initialization with progress tracking
- Configurable OCR language support (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian)
- Image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy (converts to high-contrast B&W)
- Confidence scoring for each recognized subtitle

## Advanced Settings:

- Frame sampling interval (100-2000ms)
- Subtitle region positioning (Y position and height)
- Minimum OCR confidence threshold
- Text similarity detection to avoid duplicates
- Optional image preprocessing toggle

## Export Options:

- SRT format (standard subtitle format)
- WebVTT format (web-compatible)

## User Experience:

- Real-time progress tracking with percentage
- Detailed processing logs showing each detected subtitle
- Confidence scores displayed for each subtitle
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Installation:

''' 
 npm install tesseract.js lucide-react
'''

## Usage Tips:
- For UK Teletext subtitles: Set Y position to 80-85% with 15-20% height
- Frame interval: 500ms is a good balance. Lower for fast-changing subtitles
- Preprocessing: Enable for white text on dark backgrounds (most subtitles)
- Confidence: Start at 60%, lower if missing subtitles, raise if getting noise
